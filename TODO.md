# TODO

- add the README stuff back in

- have a nicer way of mapping model names to invocation functions

- add working (slow) tests for the nomic embedding modules

- doesn't seem like the schemas are actually using sqlmodel - need to update
  that

- (maybe) nest src/ inside a trajectory_tracer folder
