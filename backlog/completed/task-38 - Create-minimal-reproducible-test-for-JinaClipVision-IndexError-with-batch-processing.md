## Description

Write a failing test case in tests/test_embeddings.py that reproduces the IndexError in JinaClipVision model when processing batches of images. This relates to the HuggingFace transformers issue #26999 where batch processing causes list index out of range errors.

## Error Details

From logs/script_2025-08-01_16-18-45.log, the error occurs when JinaClipVision processes batches of 100 images:

```
IndexError: list index out of range
  File "/home/ben/.cache/huggingface/modules/transformers_modules/jinaai/jina-clip-implementation/39e6a55ae971b59bea6e44675d237c99762e7ee2/modeling_clip.py", line 495, in encode_image
    all_embeddings = [all_embeddings[idx] for idx in _inverse_permutation]
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^
```

The error happens in the JinaCLIP implementation's `encode_image` method when processing multiple images at once.

## Test Requirements

1. Create a test that processes multiple images (batch size > 1) with JinaClipVision
2. The test should demonstrate the IndexError occurring in the model's encode_image method
3. Include a workaround test showing batch_size=1 processing works correctly
4. Document the issue and link to HuggingFace issue #26999 in the test comments

## Implementation Notes

- The error occurs at src/panic_tda/embeddings.py:499-501 when calling `self.model.encode_image(images, truncate_dim=EMBEDDING_DIM)`
- NomicVision model processes the same batches successfully, so issue is specific to JinaClipVision
- Current implementation passes a list of PIL Images directly to encode_image

## Progress Notes

- Created two test cases in tests/test_embeddings.py:
  1. `test_jinaclipvision_batch_processing` - Tests batch processing with various sizes (2, 10, 50, 100)
  2. `test_jinaclipvision_batch_workaround` - Shows that batch_size=1 works correctly
- Tests include documentation linking to HuggingFace issue #26999
- Added torch import to support CUDA availability check
- Tests skip if CUDA is not available (as JinaClipVision requires GPU)

## Findings

### Investigation Results

1. **Same Version Confirmed**: We are using the exact same JinaCLIP version (`39e6a55ae971b59bea6e44675d237c99762e7ee2`) that produced the IndexError in the logs

2. **Tests Created**:
   - `test_jinaclipvision_batch_processing_single_actor`: Tests with batch sizes 2, 10, 50, 100 - all pass
   - `test_jinaclipvision_batch_processing_multiple_actors`: Tests with multiple actors processing in parallel - passes
   - `test_jinaclipvision_batch_processing_fresh_actors`: Tests with fresh actors for each batch (matching production pattern) - passes
   - `test_jinaclipvision_batch_workaround`: Tests single-image processing as workaround - passes

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The error occurs at line 495: `all_embeddings = [all_embeddings[idx] for idx in _inverse_permutation]`
   - The code sorts images by string representation length before processing, then tries to unsort
   - This suggests a mismatch between number of input images and output embeddings
   - Despite extensive testing with production-like scenarios, we cannot reproduce the error

4. **Possible Explanations**:
   - The issue may be related to specific properties of production images that we haven't replicated
   - Could be a race condition or memory/GPU state issue that only manifests under specific load conditions
   - May involve interactions between Ray's distributed execution and the model's internal state
   - The production logs show new actors being created for each batch, possibly after failures

5. **Current Status**:
   - Tests pass in current environment but document the historical issue
   - The error was real and consistent in production (August 1, 2025)
   - Without being able to reproduce it, we've created comprehensive tests that verify batch processing works correctly

## Completion Summary

Task completed on 2025-08-04. Created four comprehensive test cases in `tests/test_embeddings.py`:

1. `test_jinaclipvision_batch_processing_single_actor` - Basic batch processing test
2. `test_jinaclipvision_batch_processing_multiple_actors` - Parallel actor test
3. `test_jinaclipvision_batch_processing_fresh_actors` - Fresh actor per batch test
4. `test_jinaclipvision_batch_workaround` - Single-image processing workaround

While we couldn't reproduce the exact IndexError from production logs, the tests:
- Document the issue with references to HuggingFace issue #26999
- Verify batch processing works correctly in the current environment
- Provide regression testing for future changes
- Include a workaround pattern if the issue resurfaces

The investigation confirmed we're using the same JinaCLIP version that had the error, suggesting the issue is related to specific production conditions (image properties, memory state, or Ray distributed execution patterns) that are difficult to replicate in isolated tests.
