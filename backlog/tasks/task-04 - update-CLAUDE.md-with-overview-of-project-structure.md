## Description

The @DESIGN.md and main @README.md files should provide an overview of the
project structure and how to navigate it. However, I'd like to have a version of
this information in CLAUDE.md for AI agents to make use of in navigating and
modifying the project. Perhaps just the stuff from DESIGN.md, but it could
include extra info (e.g. testing approach).
