## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
I'm not sure how much work it'd take to make the codebase "clean" from a
[ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) perspective, but it'd be good to add it
(perhaps as a claude code
[hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks)).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Closed: irrelevant since porting to Elixir (ty is a Python type checker)
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->
