## Description

This project uses sqlmodel for database operations, but `alembic` is used for
managing database migrations. Alembic in particular was added much later on in
the project, and I'm not 100% sure that it is set up in a best-practices way.

Perform an audit to ensure that the alembic setup (including any associated
documentation) is set up in a best-practices way.
