## Description

There are currently no persistence diagrams for NomicVision embeddings. This
task aims to create persistence diagrams for NomicVision embeddings using the
@src/panic_tda/engine.py module.

In the main.py script function, load the embeddings (in batches, grouped by run)
and pass them to the engine module to create persistence diagrams.
